### Hello World 🌏, I am Pratik Barhate.

I am currently a graduate student for the Master of Science degree in Computer Science (MSCS) at Arizona State University. I have two years of industry experience in building large-scale data pipelines as a Data Engineer/Data Science Engineer and have a strong understanding of the methods to accelerate the Big Data workloads based on partitioning methods and file formats used.

Looking for full-time opportunities starting 28 June 2021.
